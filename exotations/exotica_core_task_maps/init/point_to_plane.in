// string Base           > name of frame in which line is defined

// The frame of each Link in the given vector of EndEffectors will be aligned with the plane defined by the origin of the Base frame and its UnitZ-normal.

// When PositiveOnly is true, the output will be passed through a ReLU activation.
// This enables use as an inequality-like constraint in unconstrained optimization
